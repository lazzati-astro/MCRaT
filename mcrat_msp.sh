#  mcrat_msp.sh
#  stands for mcrat (m)ost (s)cattering (p)rocesses
#
#  Shell script to determine which MCRaT processes have a very large number of scatterings and
#  allows the user to delete those porocesses chkpt and proc files to force a new restart with
#  less injected photons. Also allows user to refine mc.par file to set a new
#  number of injected photons for these same processs that will be restarted the next time the user
#  starts mcrat with the 'c' flag to continue a simulation.
#
#  Just calling mcrat_msp with an angle directory (e.g /path/to/hydro/and/MCRaT/0.0-3.0 ) and a number N_scatt
#  will find and list all the processes in the directory that have under gone > N_scatt scattering events.
#
#  Calling mcrat_msp with the -delete flag, an angle directory, and N_scatt will delete all of the chkpt and
#  proc files of the proceses in the angle directory that have undergone > N_scatt scattering events.
#
#  In order to modify the mc.par file to inject less photons call mcrat_msp with the -modifypar flag followed by
#  2 arguments: N_lower and N_higher for the lower and higher limits of the number of photons for mcrat to inject
#  initially. This assumes that the file structure is organized in the same manner outlined in the MCRaT manual.
#
#  All of the steps can be completed at once, however it is recommended that the user first list all of the files
#  that may be deleted by the script and verify them before running mcrat_msp to delete the files and modify the mc.par file.
#
#  Example calls are:
#  ./mcrat_msp.sh -modifypar 50 100 ~/path/to/mc_dir/0.0-3.0/ 1230000 -delete
#  ./mcrat_msp.sh ~/path/to/mc_dir/0.0-3.0/ 1230000
